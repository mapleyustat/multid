multid
======

MultiD is a tool for the graphical representation of geometric objects
(points, tangent vectors, curves, surfaces, etc.) in spaces of dimension
generally higher than 2 or 3.
While these objects are embedded in linear spaces,
they are analyzed using nonlinear maps between spaces.
The primary usage is to create a scene in n-dimensions and depict it using several maps
into 2- and 3-dimensional spaces.
