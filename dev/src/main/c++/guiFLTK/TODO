1. Create Menu hierarchy.

2. Statically initialize GUI. (?)

3. Create PanelWindowButton, which is similar to PanelButton, except
that it takes a Frame as an argument to the constructor, adds "..."
to labels, and has a callback routine that does show() on the Frame.
This requires the reference counter on Frames be implemented.

(Maybe not.)

4. Create PanelMenuButton, which is similar to PanelButton, except
that it takes a Menu as an argument to the constructor.

(Maybe not.)
