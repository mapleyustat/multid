Build Instructions for MultiD
-----------------------------

To build MultiD, proceed as follows.

0. Ensure that the following software packages are installed on the
system.

rpm-based systems:

	fltk-1.1.8-1
	fltk-devel-1.1.8-1
	mesa-libGL-7.1-0.31
	mesa-libGL-devel-7.1-0.31
	mesa-libGLU-7.1-0.31
	mesa-libGLU-devel-7.1-0.31
	libX11-1.1.4-1
	libX11-devel-1.1.4-1

apt-based systems:

	fltk-1.1.9
	fltk-devel-1.1.9
	libgl1-mesa-glx-6.5.2-3
	libgl1-mesa-dev-6.5.2-3
	libglu1-mesa-6.5.2-3
	libglu1-mesa-dev-6.5.2-3
	libx11-6-1.1.1-1
	libx11-dev-1.1.1-1

(Later versions presumably are adequate.)

1. Extract the source code and change to the directory created (the
"top source directory").  For example, run the shell commands

	tar zxf multid-2008-07-30.tar.gz
	cd multid-2008-07-30

2. Run the command

	./configure

3. Run the command

	make

This command creates the support libraries.

4. Run the command

	make check

This command creates and run various test programs.

5. To clean the source directories, run the command

	make clean

Maintenance Instructions for MultiD
-----------------------------------

0. Ensure that the following packages are installed on the system.

	autoconf-2.60
	automake-1.9.6

(Later versions presumably are adequate.)

1. If changes are made to "configure.ac" (e.g., the version number is changed),
run the command

	make Makefile

in the top source directory.  If this command fails, run the commands

	./autogen.sh
	./configure

2. If changes are made to "Makefile.am" in the top source directory, run the
command

	make Makefile

in the top source directory.

3. To clean the source tree (i.e., remove libraries, object files, etc.),
run the command

	make clean

in the top source directory.  To thoroughly clean the source tree (i.e.,
remove "Makefile"s, dependency files, etc.), run the command

	make distclean

Remark:  After a thorough cleaning, the command

	./configure

must be rerun.

4. To create a compressed archive of the distribution, run the command

	make dist

in the top source directory.  The resulting gzipped tar file is placed
in the top source directory.
